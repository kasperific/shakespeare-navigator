		<p>"Say it, Othello" (1.3.127), says the Duke, and Othello begins an eloquent story of true love. "Her father loved me; oft invited me; / Still question'd me the story of my life, / From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, / That I have passed" (1.3.128-131). So it turns out that Brabantio, who is so angry about his daughter's marriage to Othello, treated Othello as a friend and often invited him over to the house to tell stories of his adventures. (Brabantio may remind us of the sort of white man who says, "Some of my best friends are black," but who doesn't want his daughter to marry one of "them.") As Othello continues, we can see why Brabantio, who has probably lived all of his life indoors, liked to hear Othello talk. Othello has had a life of adventure. He has fought many battles and often barely escaped death. He has been captured and enslaved, then ransomed out of slavery. He has found himself in immense caves and empty deserts. He has seen cannibals and "men whose heads / Do grow beneath their shoulders" (1.3.144-145). (Later in the play, Iago will characterize such tales as lies, but they are certainly not. In Shakespeare's time more than half the world was unknown to Europeans, and the reports of men whose faces were in their chests were as believable as reports of huge beasts who noses dragged on the ground -- elephants.)</p>
